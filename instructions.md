 Nike Android Coding Exercise: 

 

Make an Urban Dictionary app.

·       Write your code in Kotlin

·       DO NOT force unwrap your code or show signs of forced unwrapping your code.

·       Include a text input for users to enter the term they wish to search.

·       Show the list of resulting definitions, with number of thumbs up and thumbs down votes. Use a RecyclerView for this list.

·       Allow users to sort by either most thumbs up or down.

·       Show a progress indication while the Urban Dictionary API call is being made.

·       Write at least one unit test and one instrumented test and be prepared to talk about what other test cases you think would be beneficial to write.

·       Document all assumptions.

 

Use the API as described here: https://market.mashape.com/community/urban-dictionary.

 

While this is a toy project and not a professional product, take care to demonstrate your ability to architect clean, maintainable and self-documenting code.

Provide your application via a link to a public Git repo (GitHub, Gitorious, etc).

 

Feel free to add any functionality and refinements that you feel would showcase your abilities. Some ideas:

·       Save instance state

·       Handle configuration changes gracefully

·       Cache results for limited offline operation

·       UI design, if that is a strength.

·       Dependency injection
